              The following study explores the concepts of Data Analysis and Interpretation, Visualisation, Analysis of Special Types of Data and Analysis with Big Data Infrastructure. Exploratory Data Analysis was used to gather further intuition about the attributes of the dataset, and to gain insight into the underlying trends and chracteristics of the data. Statistical Data Analysis was used to examine the trends of Measures of Central Tendency and the Measures of Dispersion, as well as for the supervised learning task of regression. Predictive Data Analysis was used on time series data for temporal predictions through forecasting techniques. Data Visualisation techniques were utilised to perform spatial and textual data visualisation, in order to find additional insights into the trends of the data, and to present the data in a way that was informative and intuitive to a regular viewer. Textual data analytics was used to extract sector-related skillsets from the job advertisement descriptions. Lastly, Distributed Data Analysis was utilised for improving the efficiency of the data analysis study.
