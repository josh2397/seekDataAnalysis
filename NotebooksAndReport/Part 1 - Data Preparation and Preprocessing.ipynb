    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation and preprocessing involves three main processes; data storage, data normailzation and data cleaning. We will therefore introduce and discuss these concepts here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Storage\n",
    "Data storage in concerned with the way in which data is stored. Within this investigation, the Python library Pandas will be the primary method used for storing, processing and manipulating data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Normailzation\n",
    "Within the context of this course, data normailzation encapsulates data scaling. Consequently, scaling will be discussed as a data normailzation technique. However, there is two important distingushing factors that should be outlined. Data scaling is the process by which data is *scaled* into a specific range, such as between 0 and 1. The meaning behind this transformation is to value numerical features with the same importance when using models that implement distance or error functions. To provide more intuition behind this matter, we will discuss an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we were analysing the salaries of American university professors with those of Korean professors. For simplicity, we will state that the exchange between USD and Korean won is 1 to 1000. If we were to use an analysis method such as KNN with euclidean distance as the distance function, 1 USD would be weighted the same as 1 Korean won. Our distance function would consequently be misrepresenting the relationship between the two currencies, giving a *bias* to one of the variables. We therefore scale our data such that variables can be properly compared with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scaling involves the transformation of the scale of variables into a specific range. The process on data normalization is concerned with a much broader view, looking at how samples are distributed among the entire dataset. Many statistical analysis techniques assume that the data is normally distributed. Datasets that contain skewed or other non-normal distributions of numerical data will need to be transformed into normal distributions such that these techniques can provide meaningful insights about the data. This process of transforming data into a distribution that can be regarded as being normal is data normalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Cleaning\n",
    "The process of data cleaning involves finding data with incorrect formatting, data with missing values, outliers, data that is erroneous, inconsistent, irrelevant and malicious, and either correcting or removing those samples. The types of data mentioned here are collectively known as \"dirty\" data. We will briefly describe the types of dirty data below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formatting**: data containing the same information with inconsistent formatting\n",
    "- **Missing data**: data samples with missing variable information\n",
    "- **Erroneous data**: data that is erroneous with respect to other samples or in regard to the context of the information\n",
    "- **Irrelevant data**: data that does not affect the results of statistical or analitical methods\n",
    "- **Inconsistent data**: data that can be represented in two or more ways\n",
    "- **Malicious data**: data designed to cause damage or an undesired effect\n",
    "- **Outliers**: data that is deviated from or inconsistent with other data in the dataset, also referred to as noise or anomolies\n",
    "\n",
    "These three concepts will be elaborated on and used in the following investigation while preparing and preprocessing the data. "

    "The dataset to be used for this investigation is from the company SEEK's website. The website provides a platform for jobseeksers to find employers and employers to find their employees. Consequently, the website consists of a collection of job advestisement listings containing information about particular jobs. A crawler was used to collect this information and form the dataset to be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, the dataset contains 318,477 job listings, each of which is described by the following attributes: id, title, company, date, location, area, classification, sub-classification, requirement, full description, lowest salary, highest salary, and job type. Due to the fact that this information is still raw within the dataset, since it assumedly has not been processed after being collected by the crawler, the data is dirty. Accordingly, the following section will describe the steps involved in preprocessing the data and preparing it for use in the analysis. "

    "### Loading the dataset with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Pandas function `pandas.read_csv()` to load the data into the notebook. The raw dataset contained inconsistent representations of the columns \"Id\", \"Location\", \"Area\", \"Classification\" and \"SubClassification\". In the case of \"Id\", the regular Id values were 8 numbers long and therefore interpreted as integers. However, there we 43462 job advertisement samples with Id values followed by a string of characters. For example:\n",

    "```\n",
    "       Valid ID: 37915260\n",

Punctuation is useful for understanding a language, when the context and structure behind the words needs to be extracted. Within this investigation, we will not be investigating the meaning of the sentences as a whole, rather the meaning behind specific words. Consequently, punctuation, whitespace characters and special characters will not provide anything towards our analysis. As a result, we decided to remove these characters from our dataset to increase the efficiency of processing textual data during our anaylsis. In addition to the removal of the aforementioned characters, we replaced NaN values with empty strings and set all characters to lower case for the same reason as to increase our processing efficiency. The only exception to this was that the \"FullDescription\" column was left as it is, without any cleaning besides removing NaN values. This decision was made to preserve the HTML syntax found within the text of this attribute. The HTML syntax was later used in the analysis for parsing and was consequently left as is. "

    "### Conclusions in regard to data preparation and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this section we applied data preparation and preprocessing techniques to the SEEK dataset in order to prepare the data for analysis and interpretation. The raw comma-separated values (CSV) file used for storing the dataset contained representation inconsistencies, where numerical data contained charater data, and character data assumedly contained numerical NaN values. Loading this dirty data therefore required telling pandas to load all the attributes as strings. These inconsistent representations were then cleaned in the subsequent preprocesssing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest salary and highest salary attributes were the only attributes that contained meaningful numerical data in the dataset. We therefore applied data normalisation techniques to these attributes by scaling the existing range of 0 to 999 into the range of 0.00 to 1.00 such that statistical analysis techniques could be accurately used on the salary ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correct and/or remove dirty data from the dataset, and to best prepare the data for data analysis and interpretation, data cleaning techniques were used. Firstly, redundant date representations were found in the dataset and cleaned through the use of regular expressions. Secondly, the id column was cleaned and converted into type int64, and the data type of the date column was converted from object (str) into datetime64[ns] such that functions and methods requiring this data type format could be used within the analysis. Lastly, all of the textual data within the dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis by cleaning whitespace, punctuation and unicode characters, by replacing NaN values with empty strings, and by setting all characters to lower case. Additionally, specific emojies were replaced with empty strings in the text of the title attribute. Throughout this textual data cleaning process, the non-NaN text within the full description attribute was left unchanged. This decision was made to preserve the raw HTML contents of the text, such that it could be later utilised in the analysis for parsing specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These preparation and preprocessing techniques adequately prepared the data within the dataset for analysis and interpretation. Thus, the preprocessed dataset was saved to file so that it could be used within the analysis notebook. "

    "We firstly consider an analysis on the location attribute of the dataset. When investigating the job market share across the cities of Australia, it is hypothesised that the majority of the market share will be in the major cities of Australia, with more rural and suburban areas having significantly less jobs advertised on the employment marketplace. Furthermore, we hypothesise that cities will have higher average salaries than other rural and suburban areas in Australia, since cities have competitive job markets that require employers to increase salaries in order to secure employees over competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In relation to the trends of the job market, we expect that the Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector has the largest market share among all sectors within the database. Moreover, we hypothesise that the average salary of the ICT sector has increased over the duration of the dataset, which is from October 2018 to March 2019, due to recent technological advancements and in turn investments in the ICT sector by companies and governmental organisations. When investigating the trends of posting job advertisements, we expect that the majority of jobs will be posted throughout the week, as employees generally are not working on weekends and therefore would not be posting job listings for their company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the salaries of job advertisements within sub-sectors, we hypothesise that jobs within sub-sectors requiring a higher level of expertise (such as Criminal Civil Law, Oil Gas Drilling or Automotive Engineering) will have higher salary ranges than sub-sectors with minimal entry requirements (such as Floristry or Nannies/Babysitters). Furthermore, we believe that some sectors such as ICT and Engineering will have a diverse range of job listing salaries. Since there are jobs within these sectors that could be low paying, or that could be in the top salary range among all job listings. In contrast, for sectors such as Call Centre Customer Service and Retail Consumer Products, it is assumed that the majority of job offerings within these sectors will be in the lower salary ranges due to the fact that the entry level of expertise for these positions is not very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our final hypothesis is in relation to the textual analysis to be conducted. Our aim is to extract skillsets from the job descriptions so that we can determine what are the most frequently requested skills for applicants within each sector. Since the requirement attribute of the provided dataset is not accurate in regard to skillsets (i.e. the textual data under the attribute contains other information than just job requirements), we believe that we will have to use the full description attribute to construct our own textual dataset regarding skillsets and requirements. Since this data is by nature dirty, and because we are not using any advanced natural language processing techniques due to the time constraints of the assessment, we hypothesise that the skillsets we find for each sector may not be perfectly accurate in regard to the context of skills required for a given sector. However, we still believe that we will be able to provide an informative study on the skillsets that are popular among different sectors and within the job market as a whole. "
